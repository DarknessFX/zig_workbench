core_basic_window_web, not implemented yet. Depends on emscripten.

core_custom_frame_control is broken? C source .EXE crashes and zig port have terrible response on input keys.

core_random_sequence, this one is easier to remake using Zig objects, like ArrayList.

core_storage_values, same thing, easier to user Writer/Printer to work with files.
