core_basic_window_web, not ported yet, depends on emscripten.

core_custom_frame_control is broken? C source .EXE crashes and zig port have terrible response on input keys.

core_random_sequence, 
core_storage_values, 
core_2d_camera_platformer,
This 3 samples use some C specific code (resizeable array, read/write files, array of function pointers),
that are going to be easier to port by rewriting using Zig features (StringArray, Writer/Printer, obj methods with function pointers).
